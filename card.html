			<p>Gray wolves are canines with long bushy tails that are often black-tipped. Their coat
				color is typically a mix of gray and brown with buffy facial markings and undersides, but the color can
				vary from solid white to brown or black. Gray wolves look somewhat like a large German shepherd. </p>
